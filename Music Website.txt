Music Website

This is a simple website dedicated to music, featuring information about various music genres, popular artists, and musical instruments. The website consists of three main pages: the index page, the artist page, and the instrument page, along with a CSS file for styling.
Pages

1. Index Page (index.html)
The index page serves as the main entry point for the website. It provides an overview of different music genres, including rock, jazz, blues, and makossa. Each genre is briefly described, and users can click on the "Discover" button to explore more information.
2. Artist Page (artist.html)
The artist page showcases a collection of featured artists from various genres. Each artist is represented with their name, a brief description, and an accompanying image (if available). Users can explore the artists and learn more about their music and contributions to the industry.
3. Instrument Page (instrument.html)
The instrument page focuses on popular musical instruments. It provides information about guitars and pianos, including their characteristics, history, and significance in the music world. Additional instruments can be added to this page as needed.
CSS File (style.css)
The styles.css file contains the CSS styles used to enhance the visual appearance of the website. It defines the layout, typography, colors, and other design elements to ensure a consistent and appealing user experience across all pages.
